Code Style
==========
Each programming language develops style conventions; and, of course, different people have different opinions on style.
Though opinions differ on what is "right", there really *is* no one correct way of doing things.
However, there is one relatively agreed-upon point:
Whatever style should you choose, you should use it consistently.
Thus, in an effort to define standards for code submission (and just to keep me consistent in my coding style), this repo will contain a set of styleguides for each language I learn.
